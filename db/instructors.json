  "highlight": "Experience as (Web) Developer\n\nStarting out at the age of 13 I never stopped learning new programming skills and languages. Early I started creating websites for friends and just for fun as well. Besides web development I also explored Python and other non-web-only languages. This passion has since lasted and lead to my decision of working as a freelance web developer and consultant. The success and fun I have in this job is immense and really keeps that passion burningly alive.\n\nStarting web development on the backend (PHP with Laravel, NodeJS, Python) I also became more and more of a frontend developer using modern frameworks like React, Angular or VueJS in a lot of projects. I love both worlds nowadays!\n\nAs a self-taught developer I had the chance to broaden my horizon by studying Business Administration where I hold a Master's degree. That enabled me to work in a major strategy consultancy as well as a bank. While learning, that I enjoy development more than these fields, the time in this sector greatly improved my overall experience and skills.\n\nExperience as Instructor\n\nAs a self-taught professional I really know the hard parts and the difficult topics when learning new or improving on already-known languages. This background and experience enables me to focus on the most relevant key concepts and topics. My track record of many 5-star rated courses, more than 1,000,000 students on Udemy as well as a successful YouTube channel is the best proof for that.\n\nWhether working as development instructor or teaching Business Administration I always received great feedback. The most rewarding experience is to see how people find new, better jobs, build awesome web applications, acquire amazing projects or simply enjoy their hobby with the help of my content.\n\nTogether with Manuel Lorenz, I founded Academind to offer the best possible learning experience to our more than 1,000,000 students.",

  "highlight": "Hi Everyone!\n\nBefore reading about me, I promise you that my courses will be well worth your time and money. I know how frustrating it can be when you are trying to learn something new and all you get are pieces of information and you put a lot of time and money, but you do not get the results that you want. I have made sure in my courses that when you fly from A, you definitely land in Z. No hassles, no going in circles. Just moving forward.\n\nI am super excited to be here among the most well-known and vibrant community on the planet. Udemy is all about knowledge and how to utilize in an efficient manner.\n\nWell, I don't come from a Computer Science or Software Engineering kind of background. I have studied Mechanical Engineering. But, due to my passion and love for coding, I got into programming right after I graduated.\n\nI come from a very poor family and country and it is very hard to find quality education in Afghanistan especially in the CS/SE field. You can imagine how hard it has been to get to where I am today. After I came back to my country, I started teaching Web Development with the goal of helping those who love to code, who love to create something amazing but are unable because of their circumstances.\n\nAfter almost 5 years of coding and teaching, I thought it was time to up my game, and step into big leagues to target international students, and there is no better platform to start and grow with than Udemy.\n\nI have published six volumes of Microsoft Office Tutorial Books locally in two provinces of Afghanistan. I believe in life-long learning and I am here to be a part of it with Udemy globally.\n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to read this and deciding whether or not to choose my courses. Your support will help me create more courses internationally and extend my reach in Afghanistan as well.\n\nThank you so much\n\n:)\n\nMuslim Helalee\n\nLove from Afghanistan",

  "highlight": "Hi, my name is Charlie Chiarelli. I'll be your teacher for this course. I will spend as much time as necessary to help you do the best you can. But, for you to succeed you must be willing to work .\n\nI  am a retired High school Computer Science and Mathematics Teacher from Canada. I taught for  35 years,  I have a BMath degree from the University of Waterloo.\n\nI was a frequent speaker at educational conferences (ECOO)  and seminars . Most recently my talks focused on  E-Learning and the future of education (Flipping the Classroom).\n\nI was the school webmaster and served on a number of school board committee , recently advising my school board (Hamilton Wentworth Catholic District School Board)  on its online learning direction. I was also the contest coordinator for the Annual Programming Contest for the past 15 years.\n\nFor the last 7 years before I retired I was in the unique position of teaching most of my computer science  classes entirely online using the D2L LMS. Because of low enrollment  and lack of qualified computer science teachers I became the \"board\" teacher. So my virtual class was made up of students from various schools in the region.\n\nI am not a brilliant software engineer trying to teach programming. I am a high school computer science teacher that has taught teenagers for over 35 years. So I think my perspective and sensibilities are quite different than the typical Udemy instructor. I feel this gives me a greater appreciation for what beginners need to learn and how it should be presented. \n\nThe next big blue-collar job category is already here—and it’s programming. What if we regarded code not as a high-stakes, sexy affair, but the equivalent of skilled work at a manufacturing plant? I believe we should spend less time urging kids to do expensive four-year computer-­science degrees and instead introduce more code at the vocational level in high school and  community colleges. Mid career people can learn coding online at sites like Udemy. I put forth the belief that  we should focus less on the wunderkinds and more on the average individual.\n\nI hope you agree and find my courses rewarding. ",

His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life. \n\nHaving been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.  Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. \n\nAndrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. \n\nTaking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.  \n\nSee you inside the courses!",
